Please cite our paper and kindly give a star for this repository if you use this code.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6
* PyTorch 1.0.0
* SpaCy 2.0.18
* numpy 1.15.4

## Usage

* Please download [Glove Embedding](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/wordvecs/glove.42B.300d.zip), and put 'glove.42B.300d.txt' under the main directory.

* Install [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) package and language models with
```bash
pip install spacy
```
and
```bash
python -m spacy download en
```
* Generate dependency graph with
```bash
python generate_dependency_graph.py
```
* Generate sentic graph with
```bash
python generate_sentic_graph.py
```
* Generate sentic & dependeny graph with
```bash
python generate_sentic_dependency_graph.py
```

## Training
* Train with command, optional arguments could be found in [train.py](/train.py) \& [train_bert.py](/train_bert.py)
* Please tune the argument of *--seed* for better performance


* Run senticgcn: ```./run_senticgcn.sh```

* Run senticgcn_bert: ```./run_senticgcn_bert.sh```


## Testing
* Testing with the models saved in **state_dict**. Optional arguments could be found in [infer.py](/infer.py) \& [infer_for_bert.py](/infer_for_bert.py)
* Please run ```python infer.py``` for the testing of non-BERT models.
* Please run ```python infer_for_bert.py``` for the testing of BERT-based models.

* We also set several variants of our model:
    | Model        | Decription |
    | --------   | -----   |
    | [affectivegcn.py](/models/affectivegcn.py) |   Only using the affective information (i.e. Eq.2) for building graphs |
    | [attsenticgcn.py](/models/attsenticgcn.py) |   Combining our model with attention mechanism |
    | [sdgcn.py](/models/sdgcn.py) |   Interactively performing the graph convolutional operation based on dependency (i.e. Eq. 1) and affective (i.e. Eq.2) graphs |
